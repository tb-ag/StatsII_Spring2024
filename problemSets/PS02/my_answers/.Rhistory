#a#. The "higher" in countries refer to the highest number of countries' participation
#into the policy. As higher is our reference point in the regression, the coefficients
# 0.19186 for 5% sanctions, -0.13325 for 10% and 15% for 20% sanctions mean the higher
#the sanctions the lesser the individual will support the policy per this model.
#In other words, increasing sanctions from 5% to 15% will decrease the odds that
#an individual will support the policy.
#b#. The model predicts that the lesser the participation of countries, the less
#likelihood of estimated probability that an individual will support a policy.
#Specifically 80 of 192 countries participating with no sanctions are referred in
#the countriesmedium without any sanctions. the estimated probability that an individual
#will support a policy is 31.19% less probable than the higher number of countries'
#participation (our reference point in the model).
#c#. It depends on the data and results. The best way is to analyze it and make
#the interpretation.
